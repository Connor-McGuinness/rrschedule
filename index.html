    <h1>rrschedule</h1>

    <p>
    rrschedule is a gem for ruby that makes it easier to generate Round-Robin schedules for sport leagues. To generate a schedule, it needs a team list, a season start date, the day(s) of the week where the games are played and some other options.</p>

    <p>It takes into consideration physical constraints such as the number of playing surfaces availables and game times. Each round of the round-robin is splitted into multiple gamedays that respect these constraints.</p>

    <p>
      Say for example that you want to generate a round-robin schedule for your 15-teams volleyball league. If there are only 3 volleyball fields available and that games are played each monday at 6PM  and 8PM, this is technically impossible to complete one round in a single day. rrschedule will put the remaining games of this round on the next gameday and will start a new round right after.
