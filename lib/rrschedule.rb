# RRSchedule make it easier to generate Round-Robin sport seasons. To generate a schedule, it needs a team list, a season 
# start date, the day(s) of the week where the games are played and some other options.
#
# It takes into consideration physical constraints such as the number of playing surfaces availables and game times.
# Each round of the round-robin is splitted into groups that respect these constraints. 
#
# Say for example that you want to generate a round-robin schedule for your 15-teams volleyball league. 
# If there are only 3 volleyball fields available and that games are played each monday at 6PM and 8PM, this is technically 
# impossible to complete one round in a single day (only 6 games can be played). RRSchedule will put the rest of the games
# for this round on the next gameday and will start a new round right after.
